# Traption - A Wireless Trap Contraption of Sorts

It uses an ESP8266 to host a WiFI AP and a Webserver which can serve webpages. In this case, A Comment API is present to enable saving comments to the ESP's flash as a CSV file. 

The ESP8266 is powered by a USB Power Bank and can be used portably for long periods of time.

# Trivia
- Can serve content like gzipped files and even, audio and video files (on the go rick and rolling), limited by the ESP's Flash Memory and Low Bandwidth.
- Can be used anywhere using a USB Power Bank.
- You are presented with a "Sign in to this Network" option on connection to the AP. 

# TODO
- Firmware OTA
- Network SPIFFS Editing
- Async Web Server
